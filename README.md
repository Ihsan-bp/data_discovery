# data_discovery
## overview
This project is to showcase the impactful utilisation of publicly funded data in service
to both scientific progress and social benefits. The essence lies in the significance of
substantiating insights through data, particularly for the government's strategic
response to a spectrum of pressing societal challenges. These challenges encompass a
wide array, from pandemics and climate change to Alzheimerâ€™s disease, child hunger,
agricultural enhancement, biodiversity preservation, and numerous other intricacies.
Sadly, a substantial wealth of data crucial for informing evidence-based decisions and
scientific advancements remains confined within academic publications.
Imagine this: Can natural language processing unveil the concealed indicators in
research papers that direct data citations? Can machine learning find the link between
the words used in research articles and the data referenced in the article?
It is our responsibility to rise and restore faith in data's credibility and evidence. In the
United States, governmental bodies are now mandated to illustrate the utilisation of
their data. They are required to modernise their data management strategies. New
directives from the President are propelling government entities toward data-driven
decision-making, grounded in the best available data and scientific insights. The
intention is to foster transparency and openness in these attempts.
This competition will build just such an open and transparent approach. The results
will show how public data are being used in science and help the government make
wiser, more transparent public investments. It will help move researchers and
governments from using ad-hoc methods to automated ways of finding out what
datasets are being used to solve problems, what measures are being generated, and
which researchers are the experts.
In this project, we are using natural language processing (NLP) to automate the
discovery of how scientific data are referenced in publications. Utilising the full text of
scientific publications from numerous research areas gathered from CHORUS
publisher members and other sources, you'll identify data sets that the publications'
authors used in their work.
